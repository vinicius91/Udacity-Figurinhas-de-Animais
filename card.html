			<!-- Animal's Description -->
			<p>The Gray wolve is the largest extant member of its family, with males averaging 43–45 kg (95–99 lb), and females 36–38.5 kg (79–85 lb). Like the red wolf, it is distinguished from other Canis species by its larger size and less pointed features, particularly on the ears and muzzle.[7] Its winter fur is long and bushy, and predominantly a mottled gray in color, although nearly pure white, red, or brown to black also occur.[4] As of 2005,[8] 37 subspecies of C. lupus are recognised by MSW3.</p>
